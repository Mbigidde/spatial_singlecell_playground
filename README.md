# Spatial & Single-Cell Paper Implementations

This repository contains my implementations of machine learning models from research papers,
focused on single-cell and spatial omics.

## My goals for this project

- Learn to read ML/omics papers and translate them into working code.
- Build clean, well-structured projects others can follow.

## Folder Structure (planned)

- `notebooks/` – Kaggle notebooks exported as `.ipynb`.
- `src/` – Python modules (models, training loops, utilities).
- `data/` – (not tracked) local or cloud data.
- `paper_notes/` – notes and summaries of each paper.
- `figures/` – plots and visualizations.

## How I run code

- I use **Kaggle Notebooks** for GPU and execution.
- I then upload important notebooks here.

## How to Follow My Work

For each paper implementation, I will:

1. Create a notebook in `notebooks/` named like `01_[paper_name].ipynb`.
2. Write a short summary of the paper and the model structure.
3. Implement the model step by step using PyTorch in the notebook.
4. Move reusable code (models, training loops) into `src/` over time.
