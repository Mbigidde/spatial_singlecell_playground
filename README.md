# Spatial & Single-Cell Paper Implementations

This repository contains my implementations of machine learning models from research papers,
focused on single-cell and spatial omics.

## My goals for this project

- Learn to read ML/omics papers and translate them into working code.
- Build clean, well-structured projects others can follow.

## Folder Structure (planned)

- `notebooks/` – Kaggle notebooks exported as `.ipynb`.
- `src/` – Python modules (models, training loops, utilities).
- `data/` – (not tracked) local or cloud data.
- `paper_notes/` – notes and summaries of each paper.
- `figures/` – plots and visualizations.

## How I run code

- I use **Kaggle Notebooks** for GPU and execution.
- I then upload important notebooks here.
