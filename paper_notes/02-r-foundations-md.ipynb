Coming from a Python background, this initially felt disorienting.\n\nTo address this, I went to **Kaggle** and explored the **Beginner R course**, which helped me get grounded in the fundamentals.\n\n---\n\n## Initial Observations (Python → R)\n\nMany people say that learning R is easier if you already know Python, and I found this to be largely true. The basic ideas transfer well, but there are important differences that stood out immediately.\n\n### 1. Everything in R is an object\n\nOne of the first things I noticed is that everything in R is an object*.\nWhile Python also uses objects heavily, this idea feels more explicit and central in R. Data frames, vectors, results of operations — everything is treated uniformly as an object.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Indexing differences (very important)\n\nThe biggest difference that stood out to me was **indexing**:\n\n* **Python indexing starts at 0**\n* **R indexing starts at 1**\n\nThis affects how slices work:\n\n* In Python:\n\n  * Indexing `0:1` returns only the element at position `0`\n* In R:\n\n  * Indexing `1:2` returns the elements at positions `1` and `2`\n\nThis was the most unintuitive difference for me and something I’ll need to consciously remember when switching between languages.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Accessing data frames\n\nRelated to indexing, I also noticed that accessing data frame elements(such as the “first few rows”) is done differently in R compared to Python.\nWhile the goal is the same, the syntax and defaults are different enough that it requires deliberate adjustment.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Assignment: `<-` vs `=`\n\nI learned that in R, assignment is commonly done using:\n```\n<-\n```\neven though `=` also works.\n\nBecause I’m coming from Python, I naturally gravitate toward `=`, which feels more familiar and easier. However, I noticed that most R code consistently uses **`<-`**, and it’s clearly a strong convention in the R ecosystem.\n\nGoing forward, I plan to gradually move toward using **`<-`**, so that my code aligns better with standard R and is easier to read.\n\n---\n\n## What I did\n\nAt a very basic level, I looked into:\n* Vectors\n* Simple data cleaning steps\n* Summarising data using R\n* Understanding R output and warning messages\nNothing advanced yet — just foundational operations to get comfortable with the language.\n\n---\n\n## Learning Philosophy Going Forward\n\nUnlike when I first learned Python, I don’t plan to sit down and formally go through the entire R language step by step.\n\nInstead, my approach will be:\n\n* Learn R through projects\n* Pick things up as I need them\n* Accept that understanding will deepen through use, not memorisation\n\nI’m hoping this gives me a practical working knowledge of R rather than a purely theoretical one.\n\n---\n\n## Plan for the Coming Week\n\nStarting tomorrow (Monday), I want to shift from foundations to application.\n\n### Short-term plan:\n\n1. Focus on **single-cell RNA-seq first**\n\n   * This is essential before moving into spatial analysis\n2. Start with something small and familiar\n\n   * Possibly redoing one of my Advanced Bioinformatics class projects\n   * That project was done in Python, so replicating it in **R** would be a good bridge\n3. Once I feel comfortable:\n4. \n   * Move toward research papers\n   * Eventually extend into **spatial omics**, which adds the extra complexity of image data\n\nFor now, the priority is:\n\n> **Lock down single-cell analysis in R before adding spatial complexity.**\n\n---","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}}]}
